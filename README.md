             A video summarization system based on "Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning" aims to summarize YouTube video transcripts using abstractive text summarization techniques, ensuring the retention of essential elements and content.
•	The system focuses on optimizing the length of video scripts.
•	For NLP, we implemented the Hugging Face Transformer in Python for efficient text summarization of video transcripts. This well-trained transformer employs an optimal algorithm for summarization.
•	It generates new text by comprehensively understanding the entire content.
