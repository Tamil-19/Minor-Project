The total amount of data which we are having it is almost almost almost 1500 data is there okay so it is a demi data and we have almost 44 columns or 40 to 44 columns are there .\\', \\' 70 or 60 percent of work is nothing but studying the data how the data is or what we can say populated or brought into the database and at what level it is from what granularity is Flowing to the lowest granularity if you have idea of this data then it will be very easy for you to make a dashboard from it .\\', \\' You will also learn come to know how to use pivot tables you might have studied few table tables .  you I request you first spend some time on data and then start your visualization okay so this was about data now we will see the step by step visualization so if you can can can see in this dashboard first we will Design these kpis . Then one by one we will go ahead and design these charts . One by one this is designed we will simultaneously add them into the dashboard .\\', \\' Ave a pivot table option right so we will create a pure table and if they are they are asking you if you want to create a new shoot or sorry a new worksheet . A good practice is to create separate on separate worksheets so it will be easy for you to later debug or change anything if anything comes from your customer .\\', \\' This is activated only when we are clicking on this particular list okay so we can see this is activated and here it is asking the pivot table name okay so always give the name here like so I will mention it as kpi because we are designing the kph . tically it will give us the summarized data aggregated data here all right .\\', \" Each row has an unique number so this is nothing but an employee number so we will go ahead and we will use that particular column so I will go in kpi and I will add a employee number into so let\\'s say Roots all right and now let\\'s put it into values because we want the sum of it or whatever we want to take .\", \\' So see whenever clicking outside it will be deactivated so you have to click on that particular keyword table whatever the dialog box has been created or later when you are creating any value . Click here to see how to bring that window back so click click on this particular values which are generated from field table .\\', \\' Three KPS we are created we need to create an active employees and activation rate so how to find the active implies so always remember guys . We cannot take directly in them into the dashboard we have to extract them outside the pivot table . We need to find active employees, activation rate and attrition rate .\\', \\' We want to determine the excuse in place and before that I will show you how these values are changed so I will just click on our table Google analyze I will insert a slicer slicer . The values are also extracted from here itself so those will also change see for mail female you can see both values are changing all right .\\', \\' Select all the values in that vertical filter right the next one what we want is active employee . attrition count is nothing but 237 employees have left the company and we can say they have switched to another job . attrition rate rate rate is in the form of percentage so we will convert it into percentage .\\', \" K page has been created so now before going ahead I will what I will do I will simultaneously prepare a preparable dashboard also what is it so now we will start putting these values in our dashboard . I\\'ve already created a background for our dashboard so whenever I am going into this background I will open this .\", \\' This is a few backgrounds which I have already created for you . You can use the same background so we just have to copy from here and we have to put it into our Excel sheet the wherever we are using that . If you want a separate video on how to create this beautiful backgrounds I will let let me know in the comments .\\', \" Everything is selected so I will just press Ctrl C and everything will be copied because I\\'ve already grouped those and I will go into our Excel sheet . I will put the layout as well into our description box where you can go ahead and download the layouts as well look if you can see in the layouts I will show you so if let\\'s say if you want to change the color of this particular layouts into your own color so what you have to do is whenever I\\'m clicking once everything is selected .\", \\' You have to just select each and every elements from here and you can just right click and then you can go into format objects and then go into fill options so whatever fill options you have to give you can give any color if you want so this is also one way where you can change your backgrgr .\\', \\' This is the background for this video I will be using . This is a dashboard design . You can use any of this or you can use your own . ound color you can change your own color settings . The dashboard name I will give it later so what we want here is if we can see our this dashboard what we are doing .\\', \\' The font is not available already in Excel or Excel 365 version you are using if you have to go ahead in Google . You have to download it and install it and the workbook which is already open is still open . The font will be still displayed in your system all right .\\', \\' We will use a color for this font color which I will be using is I will go ahead and I will use this for more colors and means custom colors . We will copy our color here perfect so uh the color code which we have used let me show you that again .\\', \" Select our text box then go in our formula bar price is equal to go to in kpis options and select this value and press enter okay so I will just repeat the repeat again what you have to do okay so just let me delete this first so select this text box okay it\\'s it should there should be no cursor .\", \\' First we will create all the kpis all right and then I will mention uh how to add the shapes over here all right so if I go in our this sheet you can see our first kPa has been created same we have created here as well okay so what we can do I will just increase the size of this a little bit we can make it 15 okay this looks fine all right .\\', \" Ave to create similar in similar way we have to create the same keypad so for this what we will do I will select these two okay and I will just Ctrl C and Ctrl okay we are just copying it and pasting it and I\\'ll bring it over here all right and we can change this name we want it as attrition call it .\", \\' We have already designed our foreign kpis so next thing what we will do I will change the background here as well so I will go in a wave and I will hide the grid lines and go in file sorry in file . 26 all right so the same way again .\\', \" Employees employees I will be opening this and I will just go ahead and copy this . Employees employees are nothing but the active employee and we\\'ll just close this but for other shapes I will go ahead . The next next one is take the age copy Ctrl B this is for my age then we want admission one so this will be for attrition one .\", \" KPS has been created so next thing I will we will just name our dashboard as well so I will go and insert a text box . d I will increase the 400 and I will make it as let\\'s say 18. and I\\'ll just okay 18 . I will just increase the size to 32 we can make it 36 Hertz of it and if you want we can increase this to 40. that\\'s 2 large 38 no 37 okay this is good and we will change the color to blue all right .\", \" We will change the phone to light to Black we will Center it and make the font as 14 or if we can make it as 16 is also fine and we will change our this okay so it\\'s too big so we will decrease the font we\\'ll make it 14 all right so this looks good so now just we have to add our ratings over here .\", \\' Excel is a spatial visualization tool Excel take a little much effort to do but yeah we can we can manage that much all right so for that what we have is a job satisfaction rating . We have added a Stars over here and behind that there is one more bar chart so how to do that that is important I will show you how to use Excel .\\', \\' This is our overall job satisfaction rating so just what I will do I will keep it up to one single decimal point all right and now from here we have to create our Bachelor or what we can say uh first we will create a donut chart so for that I will take here is uh . I will extract the values these values outside of the pure table create a dominant chart .\\', \\' We can say a job satisfaction ratings so now next thing what we have to do is create a percentage so we will take this divided by the total of uh all the ratings so this is nothing total is nothing but divided by four we will just click 4 and I will just decrease it down so you can see the total job satisfaction rating is 2.6 out of how much uh like one point uh like out of 165 percent .\\', \" The next thing what we will do I will copy this and we will bring it into a dashboard okay I will name the sheet as Dash .  I will just make it a little smaller and keep it over here . We will try to insert a slicer and see if everything looks good so we\\'ll just insert the slicer not a timeline .\", \" Rd I will try to use some different colors okay so or if you can see uh if I find some colors, I connect a new same color so now click on this particular bar chart . Click or choose the transparency as let\\'s say five percent okay and then next select this one the outer part that is blue one .\", \" We don\\'t want border here so we\\'ll just click on no and we want it to for fill okay .  I will just select the first one and I will choose yellow for this and for this I\\'ll just choose green one .  We will just increase a little bit size of this okay and we will place it properly so it\\'s fitted so in this particular area nicely .\", \" ll kpi over here all right so what we will do is create a text box and we will add it over here . We don\\'t want any cursor we will click is equal to we\\'re going to rating and we want this rating to be displayed and we should go okay it will increase a little bit size for this .\", \" From these two values I will create a bar chart so I will just delete this for now .  satisfaction rating what I will do uh for job ratings uh or we can use the same as well . We don\\'t want title delete this . We want the axis so now we can see why we want it up to only four .\", \\' We will do it manually so we will click on format axis . Minimum it is saying at the minimum we want it as 0 and the maximum it is 4. click enter so you can see our axis has been modified . Now we can see with respect to our Gmail female as well actualizer it is changing so I will add one more slicer .\\', \\' The chart will be filled into this particular area all right so this is what we have created the bar chart so after creating our bar chart which is a converted form of a stack bar chart we have just switched the data series . the chart will then be filled with stars behind which this will go and then we will be using our star ratings .\\', \\' Gned properly in perfect horizontal shape and I will distribute it horizontally so what does this it distributes the Stars horizontally in perfect manner all right and if you want if you can bring them a little closer as well and right so this is fine now what we want we want a rectangular shape which will be on which will create over them exactly right .\\', \\' Only single shape is there now and you can see it has been created nicely so we will be using this same into our dashboard all right so I will just copy this for now and we will go into our Excel go to our dashboard and copier . Make sure it is perfectly aligned and it should be fitted properly into our stars .\\', \" This will take some a little formatting for you so I will go again to this shape and I will increase the transparency to let\\'s say 10 percent oh nothing percent we will increase to five percent perfect so it is not required we will keep at zero . Make sure you first copy the chart and then you copy the star rating .\", \\' Ause it was not going back right we want to send it to back but it was going so first create first bring our uh that particular chart from star rating this bar chart copy these two dashboard first and then bring your uh other one to the sheet right so this is how it will work . If you want we can increase the size of a little bit so it will look perfectly nice this is fine .\\']'"
